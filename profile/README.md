# August-DotNet-Batch

Welcome to our .NET projects organization! This document outlines the guidelines and workflow for contributing to our repositories.

## Team Access and Permissions

- Team members are added with repository-level access
- Members can push/pull to their respective repositories
- Only team leads have merge permissions to the upstream main branch

## Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository locally:
3. Add upstream remote
   
### 2. Branch Management
1. Upstream repository has only one branch: main
2. Each developer should create their own branch in their fork:

### 3. Development Process
1. Always pull latest changes from upstream before starting work
2. Make your changes in your personal branch
3. Commit your changes:
4. Push to your fork (origin):   

### 4. Pull Request Process
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your fork's branch to the upstream main branch
2. Ensure PR description clearly describes the changes
3. Wait for team lead review
4. Address any requested changes


### Important Notes
1. Never push directly to upstream main branch
2. Keep your fork's main branch clean and updated
3. Always create PRs from your named branch
4. Maintain clear commit messages
5. Regular communication with team lead about PR status

### Code Review
1. Team leads will review PRs
2. Only team leads can merge PRs to upstream main
3. Address review comments promptly
